<p><em>The White Book</em> is a reflective and poetic work about loss, grief, and memory, centered around the color white. Inspired by the death of her older sister, the book explores white objects like snow, rice, and swaddling bands, tying them to themes of purity and life’s fragility. Written in short, meditative chapters, it blurs the lines between memoir, poetry, and fiction. Critics praise its lyrical language and emotional depth, offering readers a quiet, thought-provoking experience about the connections between life, death, and remembrance.</p>
