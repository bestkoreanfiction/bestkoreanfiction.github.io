<p><em>City of Orange</em> begins with a man waking up injured and disoriented in a barren, post-apocalyptic world. Struggling to survive and piece together his fragmented memories, he confronts a desolate landscape filled with sparse encounters—an old man, a mysterious boy, and a crow—while flashes of a past life resurface. David Yoon’s novel is a deeply introspective exploration of grief, identity, and the human spirit, weaving a poignant narrative of survival and redemption.</p>
