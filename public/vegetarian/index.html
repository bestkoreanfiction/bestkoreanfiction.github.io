                    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em>The Vegetarian</em> is an unsettling and poetic novel that delves into the depths of nonconformity, bodily autonomy, and societal repression. When Yeong-hye, an ordinary South Korean woman, decides to stop eating meat after a disturbing dream, her life spirals into chaos. Her decision disrupts her family and community, exposing deep-seated violence, patriarchal expectations, and misunderstandings about agency.</p>
<p>Told through three distinct perspectives—her abusive husband, her obsessive brother-in-law, and her conflicted sister—the story paints a fragmented picture of Yeong-hye’s rebellion and eventual descent. Blurring the lines between mental illness and resistance, Kang uses dark, lyrical prose to critique societal norms and gender roles. <em>The Vegetarian</em> is a bold, provocative exploration of identity and the human spirit, hailed for its emotional intensity and allegorical depth.</p>
