<p>Finding Jiwon* follows Jiwon Park, a successful advertising professional in Seoul who, overwhelmed by burnout, retreats to her childhood coastal village of Haedong. What begins as a temporary escape turns into a transformative journey as she reconnects with her roots, guided by her childhood friend Hyeri, now a single mother, and Minjae, a contemplative coffee shop owner. Through the rhythms of small-town life and her efforts to revitalize the community through a festival, Jiwon rediscovers her purpose, the power of connection, and what it means to truly thrive.</p>
