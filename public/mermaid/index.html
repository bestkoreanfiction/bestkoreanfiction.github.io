<p><em>The Mermaid from Jeju</em> follows Goh Junja, a skilled young diver whose life is upended when her mother dies during a dive she was supposed to undertake. Set against the backdrop of a nation grappling with the aftermath of Japanese occupation and the arrival of U.S. forces, the novel explores themes of family, resilience, and the complexities of human connections. Junja’s journey takes her from the ocean to the mountains, where a fateful encounter with a mountain boy changes her life. As political tensions rise and personal tragedies mount, Junja must find a way to survive in a rapidly changing world. Hahn’s storytelling is both immersive and poignant, blending magical realism with historical insight.</p>
