<p><em>Greek Lessons</em> by Han Kang is a contemplative novel about two isolated souls navigating personal grief and rediscovering connection. Set in Seoul, the story follows a young woman who has lost her voice and her Greek language teacher, who is gradually losing his sight. As their lives intertwine, their shared anguish leads to an unlikely bond, exploring the redemptive possibilities of language and human intimacy.</p>
<p>Written in lyrical prose and translated by Deborah Smith and Emily Yae Won, the novel delves into themes of alienation, memory, and identity. A meditation on the limitations and power of language, <em>Greek Lessons</em> invites readers to reflect on how we bridge the gaps in communication and understanding.</p>
