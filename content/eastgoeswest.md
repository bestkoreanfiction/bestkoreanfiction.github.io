Overview:
*East Goes West* tells the story of Chungpa Han, a young Korean immigrant who arrives in New York with little more than dreams and a suitcase full of Shakespeare. As he navigates the complex landscape of early 20th-century America, Han takes on a variety of roles—student, worker, traveler—observing the contradictions of a nation full of promise yet rife with prejudice and materialism.
