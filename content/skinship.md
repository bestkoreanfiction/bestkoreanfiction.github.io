## Overview: 
*Skinship* is a debut collection of eight short stories by Yoon Choi, centering on Korean-American families navigating identity, relationships, and loss. With delicate prose and emotional precision, Choi captures moments of tenderness, disappointment, and resilience across generationsâ€”where meaning is often found between languages and silences. From arranged marriages to long-held secrets and generational rifts, these deeply human stories showcase Choi's ability to blend compassion and insight.
