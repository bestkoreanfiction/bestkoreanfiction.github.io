## Overview
*Please Look After Mom* is an emotionally evocative novel that delves into the intricacies of family relationships and the hidden depths of a mother’s sacrifices. When sixty-nine-year-old So-nyo vanishes in the chaos of a Seoul subway station, her family’s frantic search forces them to confront their own guilt, regrets, and lack of understanding about the woman they called Mom.

Told through the alternating perspectives of her daughter, son, husband, and So-nyo herself, the novel paints a portrait of a seemingly ordinary life that reveals extraordinary layers of love, loss, and resilience. A bestseller in Korea and an international sensation, the novel is both a tribute to motherhood and a universal story of human connection.
