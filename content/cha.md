## Overview
*If I Had Your Face* plunges readers into the mesmerising and cutthroat world of contemporary Seoul. Through the lives of four women living in the same apartment building, Frances Cha weaves a tale of ambition, societal pressure, and tenuous friendships. 

Kyuri, an exquisitely beautiful woman, works at an exclusive room salon entertaining businessmen, but her status is threatened by a reckless mistake. Miho, her roommate, is a talented artist who returns to Korea after studying in New York, finding herself in a precarious relationship with a wealthy heir. Ara, a mute hairstylist, obsesses over a K-Pop star while supporting her best friend’s dream of extreme plastic surgery. Meanwhile, Wonna, a newlywed, grapples with the harsh realities of raising a child in a brutal economy.

Through alternating perspectives, Cha paints a vivid picture of South Korea’s beauty standards, class divisions, and gender expectations, while offering universal reflections on survival, ambition, and friendship.
