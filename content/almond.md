## Overview
*Almond* is a coming-of-age novel that explores themes of difference, resilience, and empathy. The story follows Yunjae, a boy born with a condition called Alexithymia, which makes it hard for him to feel emotions like fear, anger, or joy. Raised lovingly by his mother and grandmother, Yunjae grows up with a system of reminders and lessons to help him navigate a world that struggles to understand him.

Yunjaeâ€™s life takes a tragic turn on his sixteenth birthday when a random act of violence leaves him alone and vulnerable. Struggling to cope, his world is further shaken by Gon, a troubled teenager who initially bullies him but later becomes an unlikely friend. Through their surprising bond and the influence of others, Yunjae embarks on a journey of emotional growth, questioning what it means to be human, to feel, and to connect.
