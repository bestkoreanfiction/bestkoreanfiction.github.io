## Overview
*Who Ate Up All the Shinga?* offers a vivid portrayal of Park Wan-suh’s early life in a small Korean village during the Japanese occupation and the Korean War. Combining acerbic wit and tender reflection, Park recounts her idyllic childhood disrupted by cultural repression, forced assimilation, and the chaos of war. The novel explores themes of identity, survival, and family dynamics, particularly through the lens of her sharp and resourceful mother. Park’s prose captures both the harsh realities of a nation in turmoil and the deeply personal struggles of a girl coming of age in a fractured world.
