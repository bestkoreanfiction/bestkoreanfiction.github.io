## Overview
*The Old Garden* is a sweeping narrative of love, sacrifice, and resilience set against South Korea’s tumultuous political revolution of the 1980s. The story follows Hyun Woo, a political dissident imprisoned for nearly two decades, and Yoon Hee, the painter he loved and lost. Upon his release, Hyun Woo discovers Yoon Hee’s letters and diaries in the countryside home where they once sought refuge, uncovering her extraordinary life during his imprisonment.

Through alternating perspectives, the novel vividly portrays the personal and political struggles of individuals caught in the whirlwind of historical change. Hwang’s lyrical prose captures the heartbreak of separation and the enduring impact of love amid national upheaval.
